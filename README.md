Hi, this is Rui. I am currently working as Staff Software Engineer at [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/). 
And I am also helping out as maintainer for [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew), [Atlantis](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/), and [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint), [awesome-terraform](https://github.com/shuaibiyy/awesome-terraform) projects. 
As OSS project lover, I also do various contributions to many other Terraform/k8s/Bazel projects as well.

Happy to connect with you and chat about anything I know.
